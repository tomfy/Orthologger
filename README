These are scripts and modules used to analyze a set of clusters (families)
coming out of ORTHOMCL for orthologs in a different way from what
ORTHOMCL itself does. In particular the families get aligned (no script for
that here), then gene trees are constructed, the gene trees are compared 
with the tree representing the species phylogeny (the species tree), 
and the gene tree
is rooted so as to minimize the number of duplication and loss events
needed to reconcile the (rooted) tree with the species tree. (Other
rooting options are implemented also, e.g. midpoint.) The nodes of this
rooted gene tree are labeled as duplications or speciations. Two genes
are identified as orthologous if their LCA node (root of minimal subtree 
containing both) is a speciation. 


The modules for ortholog finding, Orthologger.pm, Overlap.pm, IdTaxonMap.pm,
and Mrbayes.pm are now in cxgn-corelibs.
Also uses the Parse.pm, Tree.pm and Node.pm modules in
~/cxgn/cxgn-corelibs/lib/CXGN/Phylo

Also the testing script, orthologger.t is in cxgn-corelibs/t/

Does bootstrapping, i.e. can specify (with arguments to ortholog_support.pl)
the analysis of bootstrap resamples of alignments in the same way, producing
for each a list of inferred ortholog pairs. Tree inference can either be
done by NJ (clearcut) or ML (FastTree). Also can use MrBayes to get Bayesian
posterior probabilities of orthology.
