Gene family phylogeny and orthology analysis scripts.

id_2_fam_align_tree.pl   From sequence id to tree for family containing that sequence. Can reroot and prune the tree.

ortholog_support.pl   Takes an alignment, constructs tree, reroots it, and analyzes it for orthology relationships, with bootstrapping. 

MB.pl   Takes an alignment and uses MrBayes to sample the posterior distribution of trees. A perl frontend to MrBayes with some additional convergence diagnostics, and gives output useable by ortholog_suport.pl 

cluster_ids_2_fasta.pl  Given clusters, ids, and fasta, produces fasta for families containing one of the ids.


Installation:
1) Extract the tar file:
tar -xf orthologger.tar
This will create a directory Orthologger with various subdirectories and files.

2) Install a few external programs:
   FastTree (used by id_2_fam_align_tree.pl, ortholog_support)
   quicktree (used by ortholog_support.pl)
   MrBayes (used by MB.pl, not needed otherwise)
   Muscle (used by id_2_fam_align_tree.pl)
 The executables (FastTree, quicktree, mb, muscle) need to be on $PATH.
   
3) Compile urec (used for rerooting of trees by ortholog_support.pl, id_2_fam_align_tree.pl)
   go to Orthologger/lib/CXGN/Phylo/Urec , then:
   make

4) Test
   go to Orthologger/tst/cluster2tree_test , then:
   ../../bin/id_2_fam_align_tree.pl --ids one_id_file --reroot mindl
   It should run for several seconds, and you should get several output files, including 
   files ending in .newick and pruned.newick, with the complete and pruned trees in newick format.
   
   

Usage:
id_2_fam_align_tree.pl --ids <idfile>  --clusterfile <clusterfile>  --sequencefile <sequencefile> --ggfile <ggfile> --reroot <midpoint | mindl | minvar | none; default: none, mindl recommended > --prune_threshold <default = 3>  --speciestreefile <default is tree with 52 species > 

Takes as input:
 
idfile        File with sequence ids (in first column),
clusterfile   File with clusters (families), one line per family: family name followed by tab separated sequence ids.
sequencefile  File with sequence data (fasta format) for all the sequences in the families of interest.
ggfile        File to specify which species goes with each sequence id. One species per line, species name in first column followed by whitespace-separated sequence ids. (If there is no such file it will attempt to figure out the species by looking at the sequence ids, using Orthologger/lib/CXGN/Phylo/IdTaxonMap.pm, which basically just uses a set of perl regular expressions to do this.)
speciestreefile  Newick file defining phylogenetic tree for a set of species (should contain all the species in your families). Default is 52 plant species.

You may want to edit the defaults for these files, which are defined near the top of the script.

The script looks at ids in idfile, and for each one:
	looks in clusterfile to find the family it belongs to, and all the sequence ids of that family,
	picks those sequences from the fasta file and constructs a fasta file for just that family,
	aligns the sequences using muscle,
	constructs a tree from the alignment using FastTree,
	reroots the tree in the specified way, e.g. midpoint. mindl reroots so as to get best agreement with
		species tree (i.e. minimize number of duplication, gene loss events needed to reconcile gene
		and species trees).
	prunes the tree to smallest clade including the specified sequence, and prune_threshold non-dicot sequences.
